0.4.1 ()
=====
* Added optional timeout for
  all [Duppy.Io] and [Duppy.Monad.Io] 
  operations.
* Fixed handling of EINTR: update the 
  timeout when restarting after being 
  interrupted.

0.4.0 (26-06-2011)
=====
* Added a monad API to write 
  server code.
* Close both sides of the pipe
  in Duppy.Async
* Make calls to [stop] and [wake_up]
  thread-safe in Duppy.Async
* Catch Unix.EINTR when calling Unix.select.

0.3.2 (19-08-2010)
=====
* Switch from Thread.select to 
  Unix.select. They are the same on 
  POSIX and only Unix.select is available
  on Win32..
* Do not use assertions on Mutex.try_lock
  on Win32: on this plateform, a thread can
  double-lock a mutex, making the assertion 
  inconsistent.

0.3.1 (14-10-2009)
=====
* Really catch raised exception on Duppy.Io 
  operations: catching was missing on recurrent 
  calls.

0.3.0 (18-06-2009)
=====
* Added support for --enable-debugging configure option
* Fixed Makefile for BSD: call $(MAKE) for generating documentation.
* Added the possibility to restart the task after the returned positive
  delay in Async.
* Added unknown exceptions on Duppy.Io when calling on_error.

0.2.0 (17-02-2009)
=====
* Fixed typo in Duppy.Async: exception is now Stopped.

0.1.2 (01-07-2008)
=====
* Changed logic in shutdown for Async interface:
  now [Duppy.Async.shutdown t] also wakes the task if
  asleep. Still it can't stop a running task.
* Fixed race conditions when a queue starts the select loop:
  a task could be submitted, but no queue would wake up.

0.1.1 (15-04-2008)
=====
* Fixed Conditions usage for non-unix systems
* Fixed typos in the documentation, added some details
* Installs .cmx file
